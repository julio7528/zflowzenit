# **App Name**: FlowZen

## Core Features:

- Demand Capture: Capture new demands with a guided, sequential question interface to determine if they are actionable, and appropriately categorize new demands into single-step tasks, projects, future tasks, or reference material.
- Priority Scoring: Prioritize demands using the GUT matrix (Gravity, Urgency, Tendency) combined with a deadline. Demands are automatically scored and re-ordered in the list as deadlines approach.
- Adaptive Urgency Adjustment: Employ a tool that monitors the user's interactions and task completion rates to adaptively adjust the 'urgency' factor in the GUT matrix, reflecting their personal workflow and responsiveness to deadlines.
- PDCA Execution Flow: Guide users through the Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle, breaking each phase down with key fields, tailored prompts, and historical tracking. Follows MASP for structured problem-solving.
- History & Reporting: Maintain a comprehensive log of all demands, track GUT score evolution, provide dashboards for completed tasks, extract lessons from MASP/PDCA, and offer advanced filtering/search options.
- Configurable Parameters: Allow admins/superusers to customize key parameters, such as GUT score weights and default values for new demands, to tailor the system to their specific needs.
